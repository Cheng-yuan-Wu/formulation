# Random Forest Classifier, a novel tool on predicting pharmaceutical formulation

We are presenting a model, where the formulation of a potential active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is predicted by using random forest classifier. This model is buit on 5 features coming from each API: number of hydrogen-bond acceptor, number of hydrogen-bond doner, polar surface area density, calulated log value of partition coefficient between octanol and water, and unchanged excretion percentage in urine. We believe this model would benefit the very first stage of drug screening, discovery and development.

## Overview

Bringing a new pharmaceutical drug to the market is not easy. An active pharmaceutical ingradient (API) faces not only a complicated cycle involving from target validation to toxicity examination, from pre-clinical trial to phase 4 clinical studies, but tremendous costs and other resources. Therefore, there is an unmet need to partially or fully speed up the development cyle and/or to save costs and other resources. With concurrent advances in computing power, giant data availablilty, and better algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more popular and has been used in various areas. Here, we are taking AI's advantages and applying on draug development. 

Although discovering active pharmaceutical ingradient is crutial for the drug development, putting errors on deciding the drug formulation out of this active pharmaceutical ingradient is not negligible becsaue a right fomulation could directly improve the drug delivery accuracy and efficieny, leading to a higher likelihood of passing clinical studies and a less likelihood of using extra budgets and resources. Therefore, in this project we are focuing on predicing pharmaceutical formulation of any given API. 

To achieve this goal, we decide to choose an AI-related algorithm, random forest classifier. Random forest classifier is a decision-tree-based learning method for data classification. In addition, it can outcome an importance report for each feature, which potentially provides users an suggestion to either replace current features with alternative features or delete the least importent feature to improve the model.
