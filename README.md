# Formulation: Expedite drug development

## Overview
We are aiming to build a model that can predict the formulation of a potential active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Replying on different published features from about 900 drugs to build the model, we believe the model can benefit the very first stage of drug screening, discovery and development.
